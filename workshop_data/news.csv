"associated-press","WASHINGTON (AP) — Sen. Jeff Flake, an Arizona Republican, announced Tuesday he would not run for re-election in 2018, condemning in a speech aimed at President Donald Trump the ""flagrant disregard of truth and decency"" that is undermining American democracy. In a speech on the floor of the Senate, Flake said, ""There are times we must risk our careers. Now is such a time."" Flake, who has criticized the path that the Republican Party has taken under Trump, said the impulse to threaten and scapegoat"" threatens to turn America and the GOP into a ""fearful, backward looking people"" and a ""fearful, backward looking party."" Flake didn't mention Trump by name, but clearly was directing his remarks at the president and his administration."
"associated-press","WASHINGTON (AP) — In a startling verbal assault on the president of his own party, Republican Sen. Bob Corker charged Tuesday that Donald Trump ""debases our nation"" with constant untruths, name calling and bullying, and will leave behind a sad legacy of damaging division. A furious Trump lashed back over Twitter, calling Corker ""incompetent,"" saying he ""doesn't have a clue"" and claiming the two-term lawmaker ""couldn't get elected dog catcher in Tennessee."""
"associated-press","WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump and Republican Sen. Bob Corker are lobbing insults at each other again. The slings and arrows are largely a matter of opinion — is Trump ""debasing"" the nation as Corker says? Is the senator ""incompetent"" and a ""lightweight,"" as the president tweeted? But aside from those negative reviews of each other, Trump, in particular, got a couple of facts wrong. TRUMP tweets Tuesday: ""Bob Corker, who helped President O give us the bad Iran Deal &amp; couldn't get elected dog catcher in Tennessee, is now fighting Tax Cuts...."" And: ""Corker dropped out of the race in Tennesse when I refused to endorse him, and now is only negative on anything Trump. Look at his record!"""
"associated-press","WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump's four-month worldwide ban on refugees ended Tuesday, officials said, as his administration prepared to unveil tougher new screening procedures. Under an executive order Trump signed earlier this year, the United States had temporarily halted admissions for refugees from all countries, with some exceptions. The end-date written into the order came and went Tuesday with no new order from Trump to extend it, according to a State Department official, who wasn't authorized to comment by name and requested anonymity."
"associated-press","WASHINGTON (AP) — As close associates of President Donald Trump are questioned as part of congressional investigations into Russia's election interference, House Republicans announced two probes looking back at the Obama administration, including the renewed examination of Democrat Hillary Clinton's emails. The announcements Tuesday, coming amid private interviews with the president's personal lawyer and his former campaign digital director, appear aimed at diverting attention away from congressional probes into potential coordination between the Kremlin and associates of the Trump campaign."
"associated-press","BEIRUT (AP) — As U.S.-allied fighters hurtle down the eastern bank of the Euphrates River, a showdown could ensue between the U.S. and Russia, whose allies are racing to take over the same strategic oil-rich territory from the Islamic State group. While the two sides will likely avoid a direct confrontation, the capture of Raqqa by the U.S.-backed forces, followed by their swift seizure of Syria's largest oil field from IS, has irked Damascus, which needs the oil to boost its flagging economy."
"associated-press","ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — The world's most famous sled dog race has become engulfed in a doping scandal involving a four-time champion's team of huskies, giving animal rights activists new ammunition in their campaign to end the grueling, 1,000-mile Iditarod. The governing board of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race disclosed Monday that four dogs belonging to Dallas Seavey tested positive for a banned substance, the opioid painkiller Tramadol, after his second-place finish last March. It was the first time since the race instituted drug testing in 1994 that a test came back positive."
"associated-press","DALLAS (AP) — The father of a missing toddler whose body was found in a culvert under a road in suburban Dallas has changed his story to say the girl didn't wander off two weeks ago, but that she choked to death while drinking milk in the family's garage. Richardson police said Tuesday that the Dallas County medical examiner's office used dental records to identify 3-year-old Sherin Mathew, whose body was found Sunday by searchers with cadaver dogs. The girl was reported missing by her father, Wesley Mathews, on Oct. 7. Police said the cause of death is unknown."
"associated-press","WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. officials are preparing a recommendation for Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to declare that ""ethnic cleansing"" is occurring against Myanmar's Rohingya Muslims. That assessment would raise pressure on the Trump administration to consider new sanctions on a country that had been lauded for its democratic transition. Tillerson could receive the recommendation as early as this week, said officials familiar with the process. He will then decide whether to adopt the advice of his agency's policy experts and lawyers. At a Senate hearing Tuesday, outraged U.S. lawmakers pressed the administration to unequivocally adopt the term."

Guillaume died at home Tuesday in Los Angeles, according to his widow, Donna Brown Guillaume. He had been battling prostate cancer, she told The Associated Press. Among Guillaume's achievements was playing Nathan Detroit in the first all-black version of ""Guys and Dolls,"" earning a Tony nomination in 1977.
